The frankness and warmth of the poet, however, at length prevailed over the cantion
and formality of the cour-tier, who afterwards returned the fidelity of Horace with
conduct less resembling the patron than the fiiend. He presented him with an
estate in the Sabine territory, which has been commonly thought to be the same
with the Tiburtian villa, ¹ to which the poet frequently alludes. The whole
history of Maecenas indeed exhibits aversion to hasty decision, and steadiness of
action where he had once decided. ”

By Maecenas Horace was recommended to Augustus, with whom, according
to Suetonius, or the writer os the life ascribed to that historiam, he lived on terme
of the closest familiarity. How far he was qualified for the intimacy of princes,
he has not left us in doubt. That wonderful versatility, which, in the genius of
Horace, produced such diversified poetical excellence, seems to have extended to
his inclinations. He appears to have enjoyed‚ with equal intensity‚ the tranquil-

lity of litei-ary rural seclusion, and the social refinements of the court and city.
⁵ He could pass, even with delight, from the luxurions table of Maecenas‚ and the
intellectual conversation of Pollio, Varius, and Virgil, to his rustic beans and
bacon, and the old wives* tales of his country neighbour Cervius. ² So sensible ,
indeed was he of inconsistency in this respect, that he has put a severe censure
of himself, on this very account, into the mouth of one of his own slaves.⁸ And
yet he has, perhaps, accused himself rashly. There is no inconsistency in admiring
Raphael and Teniers3 and the true poetic mind finds elements of beauty, and
matter of pleasing contemplation, in every phase of human and inanimate nature.
The country, in truth, was the home of Horace’s beart: the city having no further
attractions for him than such as friendship and literature presented3 and when
he could enjoy these by his rural hearth, the proud mistress of the world had
parted with all her charms. On his conduct at the court of Augustus his epistles
to Scaeva and Lollius form an admirable commentary. Even in the former of
these he admits that a life of obscurity is no missorium, although he prefers an
honourable intercourse with the great. From the precepts which he affords for
the conduct of every part of life, and from his known familiarity with Angustus,
we may conclude, that, in all his transactions with that prince, he was neither
importunate nor servile3 that, while loaded with honours, he made no degrading
compromise-—no unseasonable solicitation ς but either complied with freedom, or
dissented with modesty and respect.

An analysis of the several productioris of Horace would exceed the limits of a
sketch like this, we shall notice therefore such only as bear on his biography and
the literary history of the time. But, before this is done, it will be convenient to

1 The reasons for distinguishing these places will be found at length ln Tate's Horatius Resti-

Tiburtian villa. a residence of Maecenas (Anm. 28).
