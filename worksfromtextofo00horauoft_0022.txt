XiV BIOGRAPHIOAL BOEMOIR OF HOBAOE.

myrtle, which they accumulated over him.l When he was, probably, about
twelve years of age, his father removed him to Rome, and there gave him a
liberal education under Orbilius Pupilus of Beneventum.2 By him he was in-
structed in Greek literature, and had perused the Iliad, as he himself informs
us,³ before he went to Athens, which had long been a place of fashionable
literary resort for the Roman youth, to complete his education. During his abode
there, the assassination of Caesar, and the consequent troubles, took place3 and
Brutus, on his march to Macedonia, took with him, among many other young
Romans of similar pursuits, Horace, who was then in his twenty-third year,
and gave him the rank of Military Tribune :4 in this office he sustained some
hard service,⁵ and possibly crossed into Asia. He freely confesses his cowardice,
at the battle of Philippi, where he left his shield,⁶ a circumstance which the ,
ancients considered particularly ignominious. It is possible, however, that Horace
has himself overcharged the picture, wishing, by this stroke of apparent candour
and simplicity‚ to persuade Augustus that his connexion with the adverse party
was less the result of political conviction than of the natural activity and restless-
ness of a youthful mind, ardent for adventure, and only brave while thoughtless
of danger. That Augustus could totally forget the circumstances in which ⁷
Horace had placed himself was not to be expected3 it might, therefore, have
been politic in the poet to set them in a less unpleasant light, and with the
mention of the event he has not forgotten to notice the scattering of thebrave,
and the prostration of the threatening, before the irresistible arm of Caesar.
Horace made no solicitations to Augustus. Thrown on his own resources, his
habits and pursuits allowed him no other subsistence than literature. Poverty,
⁶ whose chilling influence on the fire of Poetry the great Satirist has so pathetically
lamented,⁷ was his bold and stimulating Muse.⁸ What were the productions of
her inspiration, or whether any are now extant, is not known3 but the situa-
· tion of public affairs renders it possible that the XIVth Ode of the Ist Book,
in which he addresses the Roman State under the allegory of a weather-beaten
vessel, was written under these circumstances. This Ode, however, is by Canon
Tate referred to Horace’s 39th year, when the project of restoring the republic
followed the triumph of Augustus over Antony. Whatever were the merits of
his early compositions, Horace was soon known to virgil, the similarity of whose
situation almost necessarily interested him in the fate of his brother hard, and
by him he was recommended to Maecenas. He had, however, the advantage of a
still more powerful friend: Varius, “ the lofty bird of Homeric song,’' as he
termed him in his poetieal raptures,9 and, in his prosaic moments, “the unrivalled
Epic,'’¹⁰ and whose trag-ic excellence was also considerable, became interested in

his favour, and also mentioned him to Maecenas. Horace has left us a pleasing
