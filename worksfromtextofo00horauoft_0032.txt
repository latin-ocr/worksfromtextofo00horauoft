mingling-with the utmost intimacy among the great and powerfuL who sought '¹
his society even to obsequiousness. At the end of this period an event occurred
which forms a prominent feature both in the biography of the poet, and in the
poetical history of the time. Virgil, who had just revised and altered the
Bucolics and Georgica, with a view to giving the ultimate polish to the AEneM.
which he had now completed, projected a tour in Greecc aud Asia. With a
dread almost prophetie, and an ardour not disproportionate‚ Horace addressed
the ship which bore his departing friend :—

Sic te Diva potens Cypri,

Sic fratres Helenae, lucida sidera,
Ventorumque regat pater,

Obstrictis aliis, praeter Iapyga,
Navis, quae tibi creditum

Debes Virgilium, finibus Atticis
Reddas incolumem, precor,

Et serves animae dimidium meae! ¹

At Athens Virgil met with Augustus, who was returning from Samos, where hc γ
had wintered after his Syrian expedition, to Rome. Changing his former in-
tention, Virgil determined to accompany his patron. On a visit to Megara he
was seized with a sudden indisposition, which his voyage increased, and he died
a few days after his arrival at Brundusium, in his fifty-second year.

The death of Virgil was shortly succeeded by an event scarcely less afflicting
to Horace and to literary Rome z·—

Te quoque Virgilio comitem non aequa,T1Bum,E,
Mors juvenem campos misit ad Elysios,

Ne foret aut elegis molles qui fleret amores,
Aut caneret sorti regia belle pede.2

Albius Tibullus had been associated with Horace, if not by the bonds of
intimate friendship, yet by the sympathies of liberal pursuits3 to his candour
and discrimination Horace submitted his ethical writings, and from Horace he
received counsel and consolation in the sufferings of disappointed love-³

Horace was now approaching his fiftieth year, and the loss of two friends,
with whom he had been so long associated, threw back 011 his heart a tide of
generous affection, which soon flowed towards his early and benevolent patrous,
Augustus and Maecenas. The former, at once to prove his friendship for the
poet, and his admiration of his genius, selected him to compose the hymn to bc
sung in honour of Apollo and Diana at the Saecular games. This poem is, in
all respects, extremely valuable3 for not only is it a composition of high intrinsic
excellence, but it is the only considerable extant specimen of the lyrica] part of
the Roman worship. The hymn of Catullus cannot endure any comparisou
