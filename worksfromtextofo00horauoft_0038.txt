in writing to Maecenas, he gives an account of his method of stndying· philosophy,
he distinctly avows his intention not to adopt any system, till he has examined
all.¹ That, while prosecuting his studies at Athens, the Epicurean philosophy
might have first called his attention to the general subject, is highly probable:
the supreme excellence of happiness (for such was, after all, the ἡδονὴ of
Epicurus) was the leading principle of that systemz² and the same principle,
refined from the heartless selfishness which mingled with it in the Epicurean
theory, is the distinguishing mark of what may be called the Horatian philo-
sophy. That Horace had studied the philosophy of Epicurus, we leam on his
own authority 3³ but nothing is to be inferred with certainty from the appellation
which he gives himself in his epistle to Tibullus, ‘⁶ Epicuri de grege porcum‚” as
he is not there diseussing his opinions, but rallying himself on his improved oon-1
dition of body. The XXXIVth Ode of the Ist Book, in which he professes to
renounce the creed of Epicurus in consequence of having seen lightning in a
clear sky, is altogether involved in too much obscurity‚ both asto its occasion
and object, to enable us to derive from it any plausible conjecture. But m those
parts of his writings which are least liable to cavss, and where he expresses his
opinions without ornament or reservo, we find some part of the doctrines of

² In the “Encyclopaedia Metropolitana” this passage*¹ stands: “The supreme excellence of
happiness (for such was, after all, the Epicurean ἡδονὴ) was the leading principle of Epicu-
rus.'· On this a writer in “The Ecclesiastic and Theologian‚” (January, 1853), comments

Rome, and a more detailed analysis of their works, we must refer our readers to ΜΓ.
Thompson‘s interesting and instructive chapter on the subjeet; procrastino, however, by the way,

statement,'' seeing that the “ statementu which it so designates was never made by me,
either “at p. 127,” or elsewhere. If I had used a Greek equivalent at ull, it would not have
been εὐδαιμονίαι, but μακαρίτης. But 1 will plead guilty to want of precision in the expression.
which is here corrected. By “ the Epicurean ἡδονὴ· 1 meant the word as understood by Epium-us,
not as by his followers. No doubt the term was readily corrupted, as easssy capable of corruption :
but we must not take his character from the Stoics3 ‘⁴ namque ille, ut erat facetus, varia volupta-
tis significatione illusit Stoicos, fastosos et imitabiles viros, ut habeant ista unde rixentur, et fiant
magis ridiculi: familiaribus autem vera rigidaque virtus erat explicata verbis, vita¹ moribusque
declarata.”-—(Creeeh's preface to Lueretius.) A man who lived on bread, maize, and water, with
a little cheese for a treet, could scarcely be called a voluptuary. Seneca (De Vit. Beat. i. 13) has
placed the philosophy of Epicurus (on this point) in a clear light :—“ Nec aestimatur voluptas illa
Epicuri quam sobria ae sicca sit3 sed ad nomen ipsum advolant, quaerentes libidinibus suis patro-
cinium aliquod ac velamentum. . . . Hoc est cur ista voluptatis laudatio perniciosa sit: quia
honesta praecepta intra latent; quod corrumpit, apparet. Mea quidem ista sententia est (invitis
hoc nostris popularibus dicam) sancta Epicurum et recta praecipere, et, si propius aspexeris,
tristia.” The reader will do well to follow out the whole passage, which would deserve trans-
cription, if enough had not been written already in reply to the reviewer.—H. T.
