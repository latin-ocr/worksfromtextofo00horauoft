if such has been his intention, never was art more artificially concealed. Later

, writers, among whom are Colman, Wieland, Mittermayer, Orelli, have thought
›. it the intention of Horace to deter the Pisce, or some one or more of them, from

the path of poetry, which they were unqualified to pursue. That some of that
family had trodden it, and, in Pliny’s opinion, with success, is evident from a
¹etter of that writer to Spurinna. ¹ It has been too much the fashion to neglect
or despise the old scholiasts, whereas they are osten the only sources of authentic
information. Porphyrion tells us that the Art of Poetry was principally com-
piled from the more methodical work of Neoptolemus: and as this account
appears liable to no obJections‚ the most probable conclusion that can be formed
on the subject is, that Horace intended to convey in a popular form the elements
of critical scienoe, as he had already treated those of the science of ethics.

But although it may not be universally admitted that Horace had no other
object in writing this epistle tha'n the recovery, if possible, of the Roman drama,
it might be expected that in a treatise, however familiar and unmethodical, on
poetry, the drama would claim a very peculiar attention ; and that this attention
would in no small degree be augmented by the extreme degeneracy of that pro-
vince of poetry at the time when this treatise was written. Without entering ·
on an investigation of the causes of the disease, which appear to have been
numerous and complicated, the literary patriot would point out to his country-
men the means of remedy‚ by recalling their attention to just models, and
well-grounded maxims. And this is exactly what Horace has done. Although
all his precepts are intended for the Roman poet, he admits no other excellence
(except in subject) than that which the Greeks allowed 3 and experience proves
that, however controvertible may be the efficieney of his canons in modern
poetry, the Romans, whose main excellence was imitation, succeeded precisely in
proportion as they regarded the laws, which, existing before in the reason of
things, or in the practice of the Greeks, were digested and elucidated by Horace.
While recondueting the dramatist‚ as well as every other poet, to the study of
those authors from whom the best writers sor the Roman stage had learned their
art, Horace has not been unmindful of his father's philosophy,² which taught
him to ground his precepts on example: his rules, though general in their form,
glauce at particular beauties and demerits in Roman authors. The loss of the
, great mass of Latin dramatis literature makes it sometimes impossible to appro-
priate his allusione, and, occasionally, perhaps, to perceive them. A curious
passage in Cicero enables us to determine the scope of one of these with some
certainty. The first judgment which the poet passes on the drama, is on the
style of its versification :—

Versibus exponi Tragicis res Comica nonvult:
Indignatur item vaArrs et PRoPss socco
Dmnrs cAmuxmus narrari cosm TrrrssrAE.
