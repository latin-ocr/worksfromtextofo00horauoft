Ψ W a few words on the departments of poetry which he especially cultivated. ι
⁶[ffirqteated claim to the importation of lyric poetry from Greece rests on the
ij ndisguised contempt which he entertained for Catullus, his consciousness of his

ἐξ own great superiority to that poet, and the fact of his having introduced some
³} mensures which had not before been employed in Latin versification.1ndeed,

Quinctilium, with an enthusiasm which his subject amply justifies, designates him
‘⁶ lyricorum sere solus legi dimus-3⁹ But Horace had much more substantial
elaims to originality than those which‘he so ostentatiously put forth3 his metres,
on his'own showing, are not original, and are, as far as may be conjectured
from extant Greek fragments, considerably restricted ; but his subjecte breathe all
the fieshness of original conception. Nor can it bc objected that the loss of their
.models allows us no criterion of their excellence3 since many are purely Roman
in sentiment and allusion, while others are totally unlike what ancient authors
lead us to conclude respecting' the strains of the Lesbian lyre. The elegant
negligenoe of Anacreon, the daring and magnificent sublimity of Pindar, the
plaintive melancholy of simonides, alternate in the odes of Horace ; but it is the
spirit alone of these writers that we recognise3 and it is probable that his imita-
tions of Alcaeus and Sappho were of the same nature. At most they seem to
have been that kind of happy adaptation‚ which is not to be found in the
Eclognoe os virgil, and which gives the beauties of an original to an acknow·
ledged imitation. As an illustration of what we mean, we will here adduce a
fragment of Aloaeus, manifestly corrupt, bnt which Horace certainly had before
his mind when he wrote the IXth Ode of his Ist Book:

Υει μὲν o' Σδεὺς, iz δ’ ὅραγὲἶ μέγας
Χειμῶν, πεπάγασιν θ’ ὑδάτων ὄικί.

Κάββαλλε τίν xmp-ilfi, ἐπὶ μὴ τιθεὶς
Πῦρ, ἔν a} κίρναις οῗνον ἀφειδέως
Mennis· αὖτοιρ ἀμφὶ κόμᾳ
Mazaeum, ἄμπατίθει γνάφαλλω·
Yet every Roman must have felt the originality and domestic sentiment of
Horaoe’s picture, as strongly as we participate in the social cheerfulness of
Cowper's snug and curtained fireside. The XXXVIIth Ode of the same Book
has been partially imitated from an Ode of Alcaeus, beginning:

NE· χςὴ μεθύσκειν, καί τινα, πρὸς βίαν]
Iliun, ἔπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος·

But the whole spirit of the composition is essentially Roman, and the magnificent

. the imitation 1s yet closer. But the term libero marks the occasion, and the Roman spirit of

indignum liberty spuming the riven chain. b
