5 v Bentley asserts that Horace not only published each book separately3 but
feven that he was never engaged iu lyric and satiric poetry at the same time;
r ‘that he never wrote an ode while he was employed in completing a book of
atim, opimas, or epodes.· With respect to the publication, there is every
reason to suppose that it took place in separate books, and that Bentlcy’s
:mangement is substantially correct. Canon Tate‚ in his “ Horatius Restitutus‚''
adopts it implicitly.. The high authority of Mr. Fyues olium, while allowing
that “the dates of Bentley (which are given upon conjecture), are, in some
cases, at variance with facts,” admits the general exactness of the great critic.
“And it is probable‚'’ he adds, “ that, although these works were originally
published in books, and in tlte order assiqned by Bentley, yet, iu the present
copies, some pieoes may have been transposed· But Bentley entered little into
the fedings of a poet, especially a poet of Horace's cast, in supposing that so
various and versatile a genius could sit down to the composition of a book of
odes m· enims, and never deviate from the line which he prescribed. Such an
hypothesis is contradictory to all the history of poetical genius, and to every
exterml and internal evidence connected with the writings of Horace. Though
Bentley's chronolog-y has been sharply assailed by continental scholars, the con-
firmation of the ‘⁴ Fasti Hellenici ’' may amply compensate his memory for the
soverent attacks. He has, at least, established the order of publication almost
beyond dispute3 and this is not unimportant. His criticisms‚ derived from a
compar-ison of external history with the contents of the Horatian poem8‚ have
v received confirmation from a quarter which even his sagacity did not anticipate.
Canon 'rate has clearly demonstrated, from a comparison of the first three books
of Odes with the fourth, that the versification is more artificially constructed in
the latter, and that time and practice had produced a more sensitive ear and a
severer taste. .
We subjoin a scheme of chronology according to several high authorities.
