. The philosophy of Horace was severely tested by the death of his early
stiend and best patron, Maecenas, u. c. 746: nor does it appear that it
enablcd him ιο reoover the calamity, as he died a very short time after.
Maeoenas had, for along time, existed in what Pliny calls a perpetual fever3 he
was living in the greatest misery, and yet regarding death as the greatest con-
ceivahle of evils3 his sleep was procured by wine, distant music, and artificial
waterfalls 3 yet among all these appliances, he was, as Seneca observes, as restless
on his down, as Regulus on the rack. ³ His effeminate and luxurious habits had
made pain intolerable: but it is a most ungenerous and unfounded suspicion that
this effeminacy is covertly satirized by Horace in the character of Malthinus.
Horace had, on one occasion, declared the impossibility of long surviving his
stiend3 that one day must bring with it the fall of both 3⁴ and the prediction
was very nearly fulfilled. The last entreaty of Maecenas to Augustus was,
“Horatii Flacci, ut mei, esto memor.'’

Although the account here given of the death of Maecenae, which we have
stom Suetonius, is sufficiently clear and intelligible in itself‚ some scholars have
not been content to leave itin its plain and obvious meaning3 and, notwith-
standing they admit that there did not intervene more than a mouth between
the deaths of the two illustrious friends, they place that of Horace first. In
order to support this theory, they are obliged to interpret the word “ extremis,’'
which, in all other passages, signifies “ at the point of death‚” “ extremis indiciis‚'⁷
“ extremis verbis,” implying that the commendation of Horace was found in the
will of Maeeenas, where it was allowed to remain, although its object had ceased
to require it. The only evidence produced for this supposition is contemptible to
the last degree, being some pretended verses of Maecenas on the death of Horace,
preserved by Isidore of Seville.5 But, as the passage stands in Isidore, it is not
verse: neither is it expressly attributed to Maecenas3 nor is it said that Flaccus
is the same with Horace. The following are the words, as corrected by Sanadon
to support the theory of those who contend for the priority of the death of

Horace:
Lugens te, mea vita, nec smargados,
Beryllos neque, Flacce mi, nitentes,
Nec percandida margarita quaero,
Nec quos Thynica lima perpolivit
Anneilos, neque iaspios lapillos.

If this be a genuine restoration of the original verses, it manifestly proves
nothing: but others read “ Lacenae, mea vita,'’ διο.
