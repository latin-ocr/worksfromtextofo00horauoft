nd natural account of his introduction to the literary courtier-,1 In few and
unkun words he candidly explained his simple history; he received a brief an·
οπως and, in nine months after his introduction, that lordly monarch of wits
mund him to the number of his subjecte. His earliest composition after this
event is, probably, that which stands first in his works3 at least, he informs us
that his first poem was composed in honour of Maecenas 32 and this Ode has the
appearance of being written under such circumstances. It describes the various
pun-suits of mankind briefly‚ but comprehensively; it touches on the addiction of
each individual to his own3 and it concludes with an animated eulogy on Poetry‚
describing the author’s exclusive devotion to its cultivation, and expressing a
hope that Maecenas would class him among the lyric hards. His patron as-
sented3 and the consequent cessation of jealous malevolence is gratefully and
exultingly celebrated by Horace, in the IIIrd Ode of his IVth Book.

Though Maecenas was slow 'in the formation of the poet's acquaintance, he
showed himself forward in its cultivation asterwards3 and Horace, very shortly
aster he had been thus noticed, accompanied the Minister on his journey to
Brundusium, whither he was sent by Augustus to treat with Antony, who was
then menacing Italy with arenewal of the civil wars. This event must have
taken place at so early a period of Horace's acquaintance with Maecenas,
that some writers have supposed that the poet celebrated in his Journey to
Brundusium an expedition of a similar nature, which Maecenas under-
took two years aster, when Antony landed at Tarentum, but the name of
Coccejus Nerva, which occurs in the Satire, restn'cts the subject to the earlier
event, as that person attended only on the former expedition. On this occasion
Horace had an opportunity of enjoying the society of his friends virgil, Varius,
and Plotius. The enthusiasm of his admiration for these illustrious men, and the
warmth of his attachment, so exquisitely expressed in his Satire on the occasion,
are among the many proofs that rivalry in ingenuous studies is far from being
necessarily connected with disingenuous passions 3 and that the friendships which
result from literary, and especially poetical, sympathy, are ordinarily the most
exalted aud permanent of any.. But although Maecenas took every opportunity
of conversing with Horace, his caution and reserve were still maintained: for
that at the end of seven years they had not attained a strictly confidential fami-
, liarity, is the least that can he inferred from what Horace himself then says of
the state of their acquaintance 3³ although it must be admitted that the descrip-
tion is designedly exaggerated. He appears at this time to have been, what
Suetonius tells us he waS, a Quaestor's secretary: since he mentions the desire of
the secretaries to see him on a matter affecting their common interest 1—-
