Cicero,¹ speaking of the difficulty of understanding the melody of poeti-y adapted
to music, quotes the following line from the Thyestes of Ennius :—

Quemnam te esse dicam? qui tarda in senectute—

and adds: ‘⁶ et quoe sequuntur5 QUAE NISI QUUM TIBICEN accassrr, ona-nom
smv'r som'rAE smmmnass' There is little doubt, therefore, that in this passage
the poet designed to illustrate his meaning more particularly by reference to this
tragedy of Ennius; and this observation may serve as a general view of the

conduct of the epistle.
It cannot be positively ascertained to whom this epistle was addressed3 but

the conjecture of Dacier is probable3 namely, that Lucius Piso, who was Consul
U. C. 738, and his two sons, Cnaeus and Lucius, may claim this distinction.

It is not improbable that the degenerate state of the Augustan stage has lost
us a drama from the pen of Horace. No poet ever felt more deeply the charms
of the dramatic Muses; no poet ever drew a justet picture of dramatic inspira-
tion3 nor could our own great enchanter of Macheth and Hamlet have been
described more accurately than in the following lines :²—

Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur

Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,

Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet,

Ut magus: et modo me Thebis, modo ponit Athenis.

But Horace judged with Aristode, 3 that acting] is an essential part of the drama ς
and, where he could not obtain this, he preferred relinquishing dramatic writing
altogether to composing for the closet3 a custom which has been always too
prevalent when the stage is corrupted, and which is often the surest indication
of its corruption. There were no closet dramas in the days of Attius and Pacu-
vius, of Shakspeare and Jons0n3 but we have abundance of them now3 and
something of the same kind appears in the time of Augustus. Fundanius was
pronounced by Horace the first, or rather, the only, comio poet of his day. The
latter, strictly speaking, he was not; he must have been, however, a poet of no
inconsiderable comparative excellence: yet it is remarkable that not only no
work of his has reached us, but that we are in total ignorance who he was: his
works, therefore, were, in all probability, known to feW. But this they could not
have been, had they been publicly acted. They were, probably, therefore, not
intended for the stage, but were only allowed to circulate among his friends.
And this hypothesis derives confirmation from the term “ libelli,” which Horace
bestows on them, an expression not frequently applied to dramatic productione.
From Horace's mention of Fundanius, and the silence of all other writers
respecting him, there is yet thus much to be gleaned: either he was a eloset
dramatist, or, though the best comic poet of his age, yet he was an author of
