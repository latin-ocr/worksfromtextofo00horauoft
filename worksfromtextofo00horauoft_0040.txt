Horace, like his friend virgil, did not escape envy 01: enmity. Pentilius,
Demetrius, Fannius, Tigellius, and the respectable duumvirate Bavius and
Maevius, assailed his poetical fame3 but he treated them with more than oon-
tempt—he crushed them wrathfully. Yet his disposition, though warm and

hasty, was for-giving and genereus 3¹ and no man was ever more beloved by his
friends, or more deserving of their friendship.

In person Horace was short, and, in middle life, stout3 his eyes were black,
as was his hair, which, however, became gray when he was about forty.

He was buried next to the tomb of Maecenas, at the extremity of the Esquiline ,
hill. But to no character does the fine dictum of Pericles apply more entirely,
‘⁴ The sepulchre of illustrious men is the whole earth.’' 2—-“ Long as the Pontiff and
Vestal shall ascend the steps of the Capitol, my works shall live‚” said the exult-
ing poet.³ But the Capitol is dust, and the whole fabric of the Pagan ritual
dissolved‚ while the writings of Horace are fresh as in the Augustan day.
“ The shores of Bosporus, the sands of Africa, the Northman‚ the Colchian, the
Daciam, the Scythian, the Iberian, the Gaul, shall know me, and resound my
fame :’'4 so spake the poet, in less than prophetie anticipation: for in lands of
which he never dreamed he is immortal. More truly did he presage when he
said: “ The Muse forbids the praiseworthy man to die.⁷’⁵
