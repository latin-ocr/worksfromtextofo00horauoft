ne, therefore, those forms of the iambic measure which the book of Epodes

¹ phu this matter beyond a doubt.¹ Εἰσὶ δέ ἐν oron} ποιήμασι καὶ οἱ οέῤῥηνίκως
οὕτω καλούμενοι ἔτρδοὶ, &volu μεγάλῳ στίχῳ περιττόν τι ἐπιφέρεται, οἷον·

Πατίρ Λυκόμβαι, weron ἔφράσω τόδις
Τι’ τὰς ταρῆιιρε φρένας 3

The quotation is from Archilochus, and is exactly the same metre with

Ibis Liburnis inter alta navium,
Amice, propugnacula.

The epode is not necessarily iambic, but is a name applied to any mette
consisting of a longer and shorter line alternately. Of this measure Archilochus
is the reputed inventor, as is expressly asserted by Terentianus Maurus: ²

Hoc [epodon] doctum Archilocum tradunt genuisse magistri;
Tu mihi, Flacce, sat es:

“Diffugere nives: redeunt jam gramina campis,
Arbor-ibasque comae.’'

Marius Victorinus is no less explicit: Archilochus primus Epodos excitavit,
alios breviores, alios lonyiores, detrahens anum pedem seu colum metro, ut
illi subjiceret id qaod ex ipso detractum esse videbatur. Horatius ejus exem-
plum sequutus est in εᾶ Ode .-

“ Solvitur acris hyems grata vice Veris et Favoni,
Trahuntque siccas machinae earinas.''

From these testimonies it appears that the Parian or Archilochian iambic was
the epode: of which Horace was the earliest Latin writer.

The division of Horace’s Poems remaining to be noticed is his Satires,
Epistlcs, and Art of Poetry, which are all referable to one head, that of
familiar and moral discourses or essays. The original spirit of these produc-
tione has gone far towards supporting the hypothesis, that the old Saturoe and the
Ennian Satire were wholly of Roman origin. Without the slightest appearance
of dictation or assumed authority, they contain more real good sense, sound
moraIsty, and true philosophy, than perhaps any single work of heatheu anti-
quity: and their stequent perusal has a tendenoy to make the reader satisfied
with himself and others, and to produce on his part a conduct at once con-
ciliatory towards the world, and consistent with his own independence and
integrity. They are well described by Persius :—
