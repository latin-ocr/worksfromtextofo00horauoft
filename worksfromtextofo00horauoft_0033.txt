‚with ‘⁸ Dicere laudes. ’⁹ Some scholare, however, among whom is Sanadon,

take a far more extensive range. They make the poem consist of three parts,

with a sort of preludo or introduction, which is supplied by the first stanza of
the Ist Ode of the IIIrd Book. On the first day, say they, were sung the seven
first stanzas of the VIth Ode of the IVth Book; ou the second, the XXIst Ode
of the Ist Book: and on the third, the poem commonly reputed the Carmen
Soeculare, followed by an Epilogue, which ιε furnished by the remaining stanzas
of the VIth Ode of the IVth Book. Nearly the same arrangement is adopted
by Anchersen- There· rs no doubt that this arrangement produces a very noble

und beautiful structure, and that the fugitive pisces which it has been attempted

to collect into a regular whole have connection with the subject3 there‘ 1s not,
however, any evidence beyond' internal congruity in favour of this ingenious
collocation.

In one sense, the Carmen Saeculare is the most valuable production of Horace
for illustrating the genius of its author. That the Romans, while they cultivated
every other species of the Greek poetry, should have neglected the lyric, is
easily explained from the unpoetical cast of the national character. Though
deficient themselves in invention, they could appreciate and imitate the more
regulated flights of the Maeonian swan ; but when the “ Theban eagle ’' was

Sailing with supreme dominion
Through the azure deep of air,

he was, to their syce, lost in the clouds above which he was towering. Horace
was fully sensible of this ; and although his brilliant eulogium on Pindar proves
how entirely he understood and felt the beauties of the Theban‚ he considered a
successful effort to imitate his style and sentiment impossible. ¹ The attempt,
however, was made by Septimius Titius, supposed to be the same to whom Horace
addressed the VIth Ode of the IInd Book, and whom he recommended with
so much delicacy and elegance to Tiberius. 2 Antonius Rufus was equally ven-
turons.³ But the real success of these poets may be fairly estimated from the
judgment of Quinctilian, who, as was before observed, considers Horace almost

, the only Latin lyrist worth reading. Although, however, lyrical poetry never

flourished in Latium, there were occasions when it was necessary that it should

be cultivated. These were religious festivals. On the due observation of the

ceremonies of religion, the welfare of the State was supposed greatly to depend3

and, as the enthusiasm of Roman patriotism is beyond question, it might fairly

be supposed that in the Roman hymns, at least, there would be traces of
noan. 21Ep. iii.
