XVffi BIOGRAPHIGAL MEMom ΟΕ nomon.

description of Cleopatra stamps it original. The XVIIIth Ode of the same Ist
Book is, probably, one of the olosest imitatione of Alcaeus in the whole volume:
the first line of it is a strict translation from a passage of Alcaeus preserved in

Athenaeus:
Μηδὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δὶνδρεον &faa-622·

But the “solumTiburis ” and the “ moenia Catili ” domesticate this poem with
peculiar felicity.

There is another species of poetry of which Horace claims the introduction3
the lambio. The word “iambi,” separately taken, conveyed a very different
idea to the ancients from that of the mere iambic measure3 an idea which the
Epodes of Horace express more clearly than any definition. The Iamboyraphia
formed a distinct department of poetry3 approaching indeed to the lyr-ic, and yet
distinguished from it by Horace himself.1 The obJect of Horace in writing his

iambica, as declared by himself, was to express the spirit of Archilochus without
his malignity :2
Parios ego primus Iambos
Ostendi Latio: numeros animosque sequutus
Archilochi3 non res, et agentia verba Lycamben.

Yet the bitterness of Archilochus, we may observe in passing, does, notwith-
standing, occasionally prevai13 and Lycambes was not, perhaps, more keenly
assailed than Menas, Maevius, and Canidia3 to the last of whom, aud her
daughter, the poet is thought to apologise in the XVIth Ode of his Ist Book.
Cassius Severus is even warned to beware of the fate of Lycambes:

Cave, cave! namque in malos mem-imus
Parata tollo cornua,
Qualis Lycamboe spretus infido yeme-12³

Catullus and Bibaculus wrote iambics3 still, as Quinctilian informs us‚⁴ they
were not professed iambographers, and perhaps Horace did not consider their
works of this nature sufficiently perfect to entitle them to notice. But the more
probable ground of Horace's assumption is that he first introduced the epode3
for we learn from Quinctilian that it did not appear in the iambica of Catullus
or Bibaculus. ⁵ It is true that the Epode Hymns of Lucilius are menfioned3
but these were, in all probability, compositions widely removed from the Hora-
tian Epode3 perhaps, written in the Pindaric measures.e The “ Pan’i iambi ’'

⁵ Such appears to be the meaning of the sentence · “Iambus non sane a Romanis celebratum
estut proprium opus: a quibusdam interpositus: cujus ascerbitas in Catullo, Bibaculo, Horatio;
quanquam illi epodos intervenire reperiaturs· The word illi seems more appncable to ⁸⁴ Horatio”
than to “iambo'' There is no epode poem in the works of Catullus, as now extant.
6 Ἐπῳδαὶ αιιᾱἘπ-ῳδοὶ are very different. The former are stanzas added to the strophe and anti-

strophe ; the latter, poema in which a shorter verse is added to the longer. The derivatlon of both
is from ἔπρίδω, accim.
