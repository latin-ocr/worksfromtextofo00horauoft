xxii BIOGBAPHIOAI. MEMOIB ΟΕ nomon.

Seven years had elapsed from his first acquaintance with Maecenas when
Horace composed the VIth satire of his IInd book3 he was then settled in his
Tiburtian villa, enjoying poetical and philosophical laisum, and in possession of
more than his wishes. It was in this dignified retirement that he became
‘⁶ noble iu AEolian song ;’' 1 and, while he was within sight of the waywardness
and vanity of mankind, was yet too far above their atmosphere to imbibe its
splenetic contagion‚ and lose his temper and happiness in the survey; his own
failings bore their due proportion in the picture3 and, while he treated them
with no more indulgence than those of others, he endeavoured, in sowing the
fertile soil of his mind, to disencumber it of whatever weeds might impede its
culture.²

When Augustus undertook the expedition against Antony‚ which ended in
the decisive victory ofActium‚ Horace is supposed to have written his magni-
ficent Ode ad Romanos (Epod. xvi.) His friendship and gratitude towards
Maecenas had now attained their zenith, when the statesman was suddenly
called tc attend his master on his perilous expedition, which bade fair to decide
the possession of the Roman world. In the Ist Epode, Horace expresses his
fixed resolution to accompany his patron whithersoever his fortune might lead
him: not that he could hope to contribute to his security, but to escape the
anxieties of absence. Whatever may have been the reason, there is good cause
to believe that Maecenas never left Italy. Dio, ³ Tacitus, ⁴ and Velleius Pater-
culus,⁵ all assert that at that time the care of the city was intrusted to him
by Augustus. Virgil has given a most elaborate poetical picture of the battle of
Actium, without making any mention of the exploits of Maecenas3 an omission
of which he could scarcely have been guilty, had his patron borne a part in so
conspicuous a scene 3 and this negative argument derives additional strength from
another of the same kind, drawn from the silence of Horace respecting Maecenas
in his triumphant Ode on the same occasion (i. Od. xxxvii.) That Maecenas
took part in the battle of Actium has been attempted to be proved stom an elegy
on his death ascribed to Celsus Pedo Albinovanus, which expressly asserta the
fact 3 but the meagreness of the composition, and its historical inaccuracy, have
caused it to be rejected by most scholare, as the production of a later period.
Dacier lays great stress on the following verses of Propertius, as supporting the
hypothesis that Maecenas was at Actium :⁶

Quod mihi si tantum, Maecenas, fata dedissent,

Ut possem heroas ducere in arma manus,
«1 ἕ Β ᾗ

Bellaque, resque tui memorarem Caesaris3 et tu
Caesare sub magno cura secunda fores.
