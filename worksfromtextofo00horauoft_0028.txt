XX BIOGBAPHIGAL MEMOIR 01* nomez-1.

Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico
Tangit, et admissus circum praecordia ludit,
Callidus excusso populum suspendere naso.¹

Their character has been exquisitely drawn by one who had imbibed a large
portion of their spirit :²

Horace still charms with graceful negligence,
And, without method, talks us into sense3

Will, like a friend, familiarly convey

The truest notions in the easiest way.

He who, supreme in judgment as in wit,

Might boldly censure, as he boldly writ‚
Yetajudg'd with coolness, tho' he sang with fire3
His Precepts teach but what his Works inspire-

Another more diffuse and general character of his writings is contained in the
following stanzas of De la Mottc :—

Qu’Horace connfit bien l’elegance Romaine!
11 met le vrai dans tout son jour,

Et l'admiration est toujours incertaine
Entre la pensee et le tour.

Sublime, familier, solide, enjoue, tendre,
Aise, profond, naif, et fin3

Digne de l’univers; l'univers, pour l’entendre,
Aime a redevenir Latin.

There is, however, an observable distinction between the Satires and the
Epistles. The former, as B‘ahr ³ has remarked, possess more of the objective
character, the latter are more subjective: in the former, the poet takes his cue
commonly from objects or events around him3 in the latter, he speaks more from
himself. The Epistles, too, are, for the most part, graver and more regular in
their matter, as well as more ornate in their diction. Their form, and the
period of their composition, concur to produce this distinction. We will not do
our readers the injustice to withhold the elegant and truthful criticism of Dean
Milman⁴1 on this portion of the works of Horace :—-“Of him it may be said,
with regard to the most perfect form of his poetry, the Epissses, that there is a
period in the literary taste of every accomplished individual, as well as of every
country, not certainly in ardent youth, yet far from the decrepitude of old age,
in which we become sensible of the extraordinary and indefinable charin of these
wonderful compositions. It seems to require a certain maturity of mind3 bnt
that maturity by no means precludes the utmost enjoyment of the more ima-
ginative poetry.”

The chronology of Horace's writings may seem to demand especial notice,
