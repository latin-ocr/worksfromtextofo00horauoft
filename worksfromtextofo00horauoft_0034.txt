XXVi BIOGmHIGAI. MEMOIR OF HORAOE. ἲ

inspiration. The fact, however, is otherwise. The Carmen Saecuzare of Horace,
therefore, is not a composition refined and corrected on a long series of approved
models‚ but a production possessing the highest excellences of its class, written
amidst a people, who, with every inducement to cultivate this species of poetry,
had totally failed in it. So pleased was Augustus with this work, that
he commanded Horace to celebrate in an ode the victory which Drusus and
Tiberius obtained over the Rhaeti and Vindelici ;¹ which poem, together with the
book of which it forms a part, was published by the Emperor’s order, in the same
year, according to Bentley, with the Carmen Soeculare.

Nor was Augustus desirous alone to have his public successes embalmed in
the verses of Horace. He read the poet's Epistles aud Satires, and felt
chagrined and discontented because none of them were addressed to himself.
‘⁶ 1 am angry with you‚” he writes to Horace, “because yon do not especially
choose me to converse with in the principal part of your writings of this nature.
Do you fear lest the appearance of my intimacy should injure you with pos·
terity ‘?'' 2 To this flattering reproof‚ Horace replied by the Ist Epistle of the
IInd Book, in which he extricates himself from the charge of neglect, with that
consummate skill and address which were so peculiarly his own. From this
highly valuable composition we obtain materials for the most correct and
methodical investigation of the whole history of Latin poetry. The subject and
style of The Art of Poetry are so similar to those of the Epistle to Ααραείιιε,
that it will be convenient, both for conciseness and perspicuity, to examine these
poems together.

Dr. Hurd, in his very minute and elaborate commentary on the two great criti-
cal epistles of Horace, supposes that the Epis-tle to the Pisos was written with a
view to the regeneration of the Roman drama exclusively 3 that, on this assump-
tion, the poem is reducible to a regular and consistent plan3 and that all which
it contains concerning other departments of poetry may easily be referred to that
digressive character which is essential to the freedom of epistolary writing. No
reader will contest the ingenuity of the hypothesis, or the plausibility of many of
the arguments by which it is supported3 yet it is impossible to rise from the
per-usal of Dr. Hurd’s observations without feeling that his connexiom, in many
instances, are anything but natural. To find an accurate system in Horace is
what is not to be expected3 a conversational absence of method, and a “ grace-
ful negligence,” have been pointed out as his distinguishing features, by an
author who entered more fully into the spirit of his essays than perhaps any
critic or commentator whatever3 and, with respect to the greater number of his
Satires and Episdes, this opinion neither has been, nor can be, controverted.
It does not, therefore, appear probable that Horace intended, in his Epistle to
the Pisos, an exception to the general style of his other epistolary writings : or,
