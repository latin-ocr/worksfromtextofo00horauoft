{drama is evident3 for an author of talent would never write dramas merely for

,ἕ the perusal of friends, when the stage could give him justice and reputation:

ἶ nor can we think very highly of the dramatic excellence of a period when the
best comio writer is an author whose name is scarcely known. Moreover, the
tragedians of the period, who were not numerous, did not redeem their paucity
by their excellence. Titius Septimius, as a cultivator of Pindaric lyrics, was
likely enough to have merited Horace’s description,

Tragica desoevit et ampullatur in arte. 1

and Puppius, though he drew tears from his audience‚ has left ns a better stan-
dard of his true powerS, in the sly and quiet laugh which he has elicited from
Horaoe.² x
The last pieoe which Horace ever wrote was, most probably, the IInd Epistle
of his IInd Book, which he addressed to Julius Florus, a satiric poet of high
excellence ς* and which, in that case, could not have been written long before his
death. In it he professes his determination to relinquish the pursuits of poetry
for those of moral philosophy, especially the suitable contemplation of his advanc-
ing end. And, perhaps, never was death encountered with more genuine philo-
sophy (in the real sense of the word), than by Horace. He employed his latter
days, exclusively, in a study to which he had devoted a considerable portion of
his earlier life, the investigation of moral good, and the nature of happiness; an
inquiry which he undertook for the advantages of its results, and not from any
motives of ambition or ostentation3 and which he therefore conducted on the
principles of right reason and regulated sentiment, without reference to the
subtleties and mechanism of any of the philosophical systems then iu vogue.
He employed what light had been bestowed on him faithfully: and, by that
blessing, which, we now learn from the highest authority, is always given to the
ingenuous and serious inquirer aster truth, he made a proficiency in the knowledge
of the situation and duties of mankind, rarely, if ever, before attained by un-
assisted nature3 whose inability to discriminate universally between good and
evil, and the objects to be severally pursued and avoided, was not unknown to
him.⁴¹ And hence his writings exhibit him, although not uninfected with vices
¹ which not even religious ignorance, and the cnstoms of a most depraved society,
can greatly extenuate, yet, on the whole, possibly the most moral, and certainly
the happiest, character of profane antiquity. ”
Th0se who have attempted to assimilate the opinions of Horace- to the tenete
of any one of the philosophical sects have been guided rather by detached pas-
sages, than by the general tenour of his writings. In one place, indeed, where,
