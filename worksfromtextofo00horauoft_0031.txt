Nam quoties Mutinam, et civilia busta Philippos,
Aut canerem Siculae classica bella sugae,

Aut regum auratis circumdata colla catenis,
Actiaque in Sacra currere rostra Vici,

Te mea Musa illis semper contexeret armis,
Et sumta et posita pace, fidele caput.

But this would equally prove that Maecenas took part in the battle of Philippi.
The IXth Epode has been thought by some to favour the opinion that Maeceuas
accompanied Augustus3 and Desprez‚ in his notes on that poem, deliberately tells
the reader that it was addressed to Maecenas in his absence on that occasion. The
student, by consulting the poem itself, will find nothing, however, positive about
the situation of Mace-nas at that time. To this poem, to the very elaborate
aualysis given by Masson, in his Life of Horace, and to the answer of Dacier‚
prefixed to his editIon of the poet, the reader desirous of more precise informatiou
on this sufficet is referred.

Horace was, at this time, about thirty-six years of age ς so that, if Bentley’s
chronolegy of his works be true, the Ist Book of his Satires had seen the light
eight years. nasson, however, refers the Xth Satire of that Book to this date,
relying, principally, ou his account of the death of Cassius of Parma, who was
reported, according to this passage, to have been burned with his books.
Cassius of Parma was put to death at this time at Athens, by the direction of
Augustus, for having espoused the cause of Antony. We should rather be
disposed, as scholars now generally are, to refer what Horace here says to
another Cassius, than disturb the chronology of Bentley.

On his return from the Cantabrian expedition, debilitated by exertion and
disease. it is probable that Augustus wrote to Maecenas the letter mentioned by
Suetonius in his Ltjfe of Horace, iu which he offered the poet the office of his
private secretary. ‘⁴ Ante,” says he, ‘⁶ ipse sufficiebam scribendis ipistolis
amicorum.- nunc occupatissimus et infirmus Horatium nostrum te cupio ad·
ducere. Veniat iyitur ab ἱεεᾶ parasitica mensa ad hanc reyiam, et nos in
scribendis epistolis juvabit.'' Horace declined the offer: and the Emperor, so
far from discovering the least resentment, continued towards him his friendsh'ip

v and familiarity. In theletters which he asterwards addressed to him, he en-

treated him to assume the liber-ties of an intimate associate, and, with a felicity
which only the Greek expression ean attempt, courted his acquaintance:
“ neque εἰ ut superbus amicitiam nostram sprevisti, ideo nos quoque ἀνθυπερ-
Φρονοῧμεν.” ¹

For five years aster the return of Augustus, Horace continued to enjoy an
uninterrupted tranquillity‚ in the most perfect conceivable independence‚ although
